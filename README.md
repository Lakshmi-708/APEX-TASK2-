# APEX-TASK2-
This task focuses on understanding and performing essential network security operations, including reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability assessment, packet analysis, and firewall configuration. The goal is to equip learners with practical skills used by cybersecurity analysts during security assessments and penetration testing.

The task begins with both passive and active reconnaissance techniques using tools like Whois, Nslookup, Google Dorking, Shodan, and Nmap. After gathering information about the target, various Nmap scans are performed such as TCP/UDP scans, service version detection, and operating system identification.

Vulnerability scanning is conducted using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials to identify weaknesses in test environments like Metasploitable. The results are analyzed and categorized based on severity.

Packet analysis is performed using Wireshark to capture and inspect different types of network traffic including HTTP, FTP, and DNS. Learners also analyze unencrypted credentials and simulate basic attack patterns such as SYN flood attacks.

Finally, the task covers fundamental firewall concepts, where simple iptables rules are created to allow or block specific ports, and a demonstration is performed to show how a firewall can block scanning attempts.

The deliverables include detailed scan reports, a vulnerability assessment report, a GitHub repository containing all documentation, and a demonstration video showcasing key findings and techniques learned.
